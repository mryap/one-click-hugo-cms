Moving to Mastodon? Make life easier for your followers. Post your new handle as a web link such as “[http://mastodon.social/@yourusername](https://t.co/LJkocpWVwj)”, not “@yourusername@mastodon.social” which displays as an email address.

If you want to import the people you follow on Twitter to your Mastodon account (if they’re there), put your full Mastodon address in your Twitter bio, go to [http://fedifinder.glitch.me](https://t.co/3SzqNpucHD), enter your Twitter login, and it will find them.
Export the file, go to ‘import’ in Mastodon settings

Take time to consider where you want sign up; the .social community, where many start, is massive & may not give you much sense of local community you desire.
If you're in Ireland, there is an Irish 'instance' (community) at [http://Mastodon.ie](https://t.co/AoP6q832AU).

*   UK > <https://mastodon.org.uk/about>

*   SG > <https://kopiti.am/about>

You register a new account at the place you want to be, in settings there you can indicate an 'alias' (that it expects to be ported to). Then in the old account, you can set it to migrate and it will see there is a willing recipient.

You can access everyone on Mastodon (regardless which instances they origin from) at <https://instances.social/> & <https://fediverse.party/> Does not have what you look for? With Mastodon, one can shelf hosted your own social media platform.

There are no mysterious profit-based algorithms feeding and filtering posts, so you get a straightforward chronological feed of everything in your home community/instance.
